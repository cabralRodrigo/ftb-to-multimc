## Turns out that the Development branch of MultiMC already has a feature to import a FTB App modpack. This app is discontinued.

# FTB to MultiMC
Downloads and exports FTB modpacks to MultiMC

*The aim of this application is not to remove the ad revenue of the FTB team.
If in any point of future the FTB app adds a option to export a modpack to MultiMC (or vice versa), this application will be discontinued. PLEASE, support the FTB team by downloading and using the official [FTB app](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/).*

*Ads or any form of monetization is not present.
I'm not trying to take money from the FTB team or modders, I'm just creating a tool that I needed for myself.*
